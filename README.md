# Antal (Tony) Nagy  
### IT Software Engineer | Tech Leader | Blockchain Enthusiast

Hi, I’m Tony — an IT Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience crafting innovative solutions. As **Head of IT Development Department** at *Eszterházy Károly Catholic University (EKCU)* in Eger, Hungary, I lead cutting-edge projects and drive technical excellence. I’m also the co-founder of [Imagella.com](https://imagella.com/), where I build smart contracts and scalable web platforms using Solidity, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and API Gateway.

Passionate about decentralized systems and cloud-native architectures, I’m eager to create impactful, future-ready solutions for forward-thinking companies. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new IT technologies, reading, playing sports, or fishing.
